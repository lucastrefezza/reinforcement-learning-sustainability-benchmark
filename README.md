# # Reinforcement Learning Sustainability Benchmark

A benchmark among various reinforcement learning algorithms to assess the tradeoff between performance and costs in terms of energy and time.

This project is carried out as part of the Software Engineering for Artificial Intelligence course, therefore the repository will also include the documentation released during its development.
