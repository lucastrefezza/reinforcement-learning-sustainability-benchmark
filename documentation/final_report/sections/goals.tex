\section{Goals}
\label{sec:goals}
The primary goal of this project is to benchmark the energy consumption and performance of various deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Specifically, we aim to:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item evaluate the energy consumption of different DRL algorithms when trained on the same task;
	\item compare the performance of these algorithms in terms of their ability to achieve high scores on the given task;
	\item analyze the trade-offs between performance and energy consumption to identify the most efficient algorithms;
	\item provide a comprehensive report that can guide practitioners in selecting the appropriate DRL algorithms based on specific use-case requirements.
\end{enumerate}

By achieving these goals, the project will contribute to the broader understanding of the sustainability implications of deep reinforcement learning technologies.
